            <p>My name is Gadisa Measo I am an Arizona State University Student with a concentration in Informatics. At ASU, I am particularly interested in the role of computers in technology and maintain a 3.0 GPA. I also worked as a Microsoft Technical Support agent at a place called Education at Work. A call center and staffing service that employs a college workforce. I help problem-solve issues with Microsoft Account recovery, office product activation, installation, application usage, and syncing emails through outlook. All with the assistance of LMI screen-sharing programs that allow direct access to control customer computers.</p>
